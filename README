ID3 0.7
=======
id3 is a music stream tagging program that follows the
ID3 specification. It lets you store the following info in a tag:

* 30 character Artist name
* 30 character Album name
* 30 character Title name
*  4 character Year
* 30 character comment
*   enumerated Genre

id3 uses command-line options to specify this data:

 -t	Title
 -a	Artist
 -A	Album
 -y	Year
 -c	Comment
 -g	Genre

Anything that is not a command-line option is taken as a filename. Thus, you
can tag an entire directory with Artist, Album, Year, and Genre information
like so:

id3 -a "Crash Test Dummies" -A "God Shuffled His Feet" -y 1993 -g Pop *

If an entry contains no whitespace, you won't need to quote it - that's only
so your shell gets things right.

Unused data in fields are padded with spaces.

If you wish to use id3 as part of a system of scripts you may wish to use
the -R option which causes id3 to print out all changes and listings in an
rfc822-style format (like mail headers).

id3 -L will print out a list of all genres.
